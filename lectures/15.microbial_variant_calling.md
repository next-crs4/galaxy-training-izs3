**Variant calling** is the process of identifying differences between two genome samples. 
Usually differences are limited to single nucleotide polymorphisms (**SNPs**) 
and small insertions and deletions (**indels**). 

Imagine that you have been asked to find the differences between a sample that has been sequenced and a known genome. 

**For example:** 

You have a new sample from a patient and you want to see if it has any differences from a well known reference genome 
of the same species. 
Typically, you would have a couple of fastq read files sent back to you from the sequencing provider a
nd either an annotated or non annotated reference genome.
