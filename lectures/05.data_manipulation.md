title: Data Manipulation
summary: "How can I do basic data manipulation in Galaxy? Which tools are available to convert, reformat, filter, sort etc my text-based data?"
---

---
In this tutorial, we will use as our dataset a table with results from the Olympics, 
from the games in Athens in 1896 until Tokyo in 2020. 

The objective is to familiarize you with a large number of the most important data manipulation tools in Galaxy. 

 The dataset contains 234,522 rows and 17 columns. 
 Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual Olympic event. The columns are:

* athlete_id - Unique number for each athlete
* name - Athlete’s name 
* sex - M or F 
* birth_year - 4-digit number 
* birth_day - e.g. 24 July 
* birth_place - town and/or country 
* height - In centimeters (or NA if data not known)
* weight - In kilograms (or NA if data not known)
* team - Team name 
* noc - National Olympic Committee 3-letter code 
* games - Year and season 
* year - Integer 
* season - Summer or Winter 
* city - Host city 
* sport - Sport 
* event - Event 
* medal - Gold, Silver, Bronze (or NA if no medal was won)

## Quick Start

1. Create a new History
2. Rename your history to be meaningful and easy to find.
3. Upload the  dataset `olympics.tsv`
    ```shell 
    https://zenodo.org/record/6803028/files/olympics.tsv
 
    ```
4. View <span class="fa fa-fw fa-eye"></span> the dataset
5. Rename <span class="fa fa-fw fa-pencil"></span> the dataset to `olympics`

<span class="fa fa-fw fa-question-circle"></span> **Question**
* What is the format of the file?

## Sorting

We will sort the file in chronological order based on the year of the Olympic games (column ??)

1. Open the `Sort - data in ascending or descending order` Tool
   * *Sort Dataset”: olympics.tsv 
   * *on column*: Column 12 
   * *in*: Ascending order 
   * *Flavor”: Numeric sort
2. **Execute**
3. View <span class="fa fa-fw fa-eye"></span> the sorted dataset

<p style="text-align:right"><a href="{{site.url}}{{page.url}}"><strong>Go Up</strong><span class="fa fa-fw fa-arrow-up"></span></a></p>
---

### Sort on multiple columns at once
Now, we want to sort twice, first by year, an then within each year, we sort again alphabetically by name.

1. **Re-run** <span class="fa fa-fw fa-again"></span> the
2. All parameter from the first step should already be set for you, and should remain the same
3. Insert Column selections:
   * *on column*: Column 2 
   * *in*: Ascending order 
   * *Flavor*: Alphabetical sort
4. **Execute**
5. View <span class="fa fa-fw fa-eye"></span> the sorted dataset

<p style="text-align:right"><a href="{{site.url}}{{page.url}}"><strong>Go Up</strong><span class="fa fa-fw fa-arrow-up"></span></a></p>

## Filtering
We will filter the file to show only winter Olympics

1. Look at the `olympics.tsv` file. Which column contains this information?
2. Open the tool `Filter data on any column using simple expressions`
   - *Filter*: olympics.tsv
   - *With the following condition*: c13=='Winter'
   - *Number of header lines to skip*: 1
3. **Execute**
4. View <span class="fa fa-fw fa-eye"></span> the filtered dataset

5. <span class="fa fa-fw fa-question-circle"></span> **Question**
1. How many lines are in this file? 


*  **Re-run** <span class="fa fa-fw fa-again"></span> the step for the Summer Olympics

<span class="fa fa-fw fa-question-circle"></span> **Exercises**

* How many gold medals were handed out?
* How many total medals?
* How many medals were handed out during the 2018 Olympics?
* How many medals were won by individuals with a height between 170 and 180 cm?
* How many gold medals were won by individuals shorter than 160cm or taller than 190?

## Counting
### Count occurrences of values in columns
Let’s start by simply counting how many different Olympic Games we have in our dataset, 
and how many times it appears (so how many participations there were each year)

1. `Count occurrences of each record` with the following parameters:
   * *from dataset*: olympics.tsv 
   * *Count occurrences of values in column(s)*: Column 11
   * *How should the results be sorted?*: most common values first
2. View <span class="fa fa-fw fa-eye"></span> the result


<span class="fa fa-fw fa-question-circle"></span> **Question**
1. How many different Olympic games are in our file?
2. Which Olympic games had the most participations?

Let’s try counting the number of men and women in each olympic games.
1. `Count occurrences of each record` with the following parameters:
   * *from dataset*: olympics.tsv
   * *Count occurrences of values in column(s)*: Column 11, Column 3
   * *How should the results be sorted?*: most common values first
2. View <span class="fa fa-fw fa-eye"></span> the result

<span class="fa fa-fw fa-question-circle"></span> **Question**
1. How many women were in the first Olympic games? 
2. Which Olympic games had the most women participants? 

<p style="text-align:right"><a href="{{site.url}}{{page.url}}"><strong>Go Up</strong><span class="fa fa-fw fa-arrow-up"></span></a></p>

### Counting number of different sports per Olympic Games
We will now determine how many different sport there were in each of the different Olympics
1. `Datamash` with the following parameters: 
   * <span class="fa fa-fw fa-file"></span> *Input tabular dataset*: `olympic.tsv`
   * *Group by fields*: 11 (game column)
   * *Input file has a header line*: Yes
   * *Print header line*: Yes
   * *Sort input*: Yes
   * *Ignore case when grouping*: Yes
   * In *Operation to perform on each group*:
       * *Type*: Count Unique values
       * *On column*: c15 (sport column)
2. View <span class="fa fa-fw fa-eye"></span> the result
3. *Rename* the output to something descriptive

<span class="fa fa-fw fa-question-circle"></span> **Question**
1. How many sport were in the first Olympics? How many in the latest?
2. Which Olympics had the most different sports?

<span class="fa fa-fw fa-question-circle"></span> **Exercises**

1. Which country has had the most participations in the Olympics? 
2. How many countries participated in the first Olympics? How many in the last?

## Grouping
Often we may want to group rows based on a value in a column, and perform some operation on the resulting rows. 
For example we would like to group the olympics data by one value (e.g. year, country, sport), 
and determine some value for each group (e.g. number of medals won, average age of athletes, etc).

We can use the `Datamash` tool for this purpose.

### Tallest athlete per sport
1. `Datamash` with the following parameters: 
   * <span class="fa fa-fw fa-file"></span> *Input tabular dataset*: `olympic.tsv`
   * *Group by fields*: 15
   * *Input file has a header line*: Yes
   * *Print header line*: Yes
   * *Sort input*: Yes
   * *Ignore case when grouping*: Yes
   * Skip NA or NaN values”: Yes
   * In *Operation to perform on each group*:
       * *Type*: Maximun
       * *On column*: c7
2. View <span class="fa fa-fw fa-eye"></span> the result

<span class="fa fa-fw fa-question-circle"></span> **Question**
1. How tall was the tallest athlete in basketball? 
2. And what about karate?

<p style="text-align:right"><a href="{{site.url}}{{page.url}}"><strong>Go Up</strong><span class="fa fa-fw fa-arrow-up"></span></a></p>

### Grouping on multiple columns
The question we would like to answer here, is what is the average height for men and women per sport?

1. `Datamash` with the following parameters:
   * <span class="fa fa-fw fa-file"></span> *Input tabular dataset*: `olympic.tsv`
   * *Group by fields*: 15,3 (sport and sex column)
   * *Input file has a header line*: Yes
   * *Print header line*: Yes
   * *Sort input*: Yes
   * *Ignore case when grouping*: Yes
   * Skip NA or NaN values”: Yes
   * In *Operation to perform on each group*:
      * *Type*: Mean
      * *On column*: c7
2. View <span class="fa fa-fw fa-eye"></span> the result


<span class="fa fa-fw fa-question-circle"></span> **Exercises**
1. How tall is the shortest woman Badminton player to win a gold medal? 
2. What is the average height and standard deviation of athletes from Denmark (DEN) in the 1964 Olympics?

## Computing
Sometimes we want to use the data in our column to compute a new value, and add that to the table. 
As an example, let’s calculate the age of each athlete at the time of participation, and add this as a new column to our dataset.

1. `Compute on rows` tool with the following parameters
   * <span class="fa fa-fw fa-file"></span> *Input file*: `olympic.tsv`
   * *Input has a header line with column names?*: Yes
   * In *Expressions*:
     * *Add expression*: int(c12)-int(c4) (year column minus the year_of_birth column)
     * *Mode of the operation?*: Append
     * *The new column name*: age
   * Under *Error handling*:
     * *Autodetect column types*: No
     * *If an expression cannot be computed for a row*: Fill in a replacement value
     * *Replacement value*: NA (not available)
2. View <span class="fa fa-fw fa-eye"></span> the result
3. *Rename* the output to something descriptive


<span class="fa fa-fw fa-question-circle"></span> **Question**
- How old was Arnaud Boetsch during his Olympic tennis participation?

<span class="fa fa-fw fa-question-circle"></span> **Exercises**
- Calculate BMI (weight/height<sup>2</sup>) for all athletes and add it as a new column directly after the existing height and weight columns.(Remember that our height is in cm, and the formula expects height in meters)

## Find and Replace
Our file uses a mix of Athina and Athens to indicate the Capital City of Greece in the city column. 
Let’s standardize this by replacing occurrences of Athina with Athens.

1. `Column Regex Find and Replace` tool with the following parameters: 
   * *Select cells from*: olympics.tsv
   * *using column*: Column 14
   * *Check*:
     * *Find Regex*: Athina
     * *Replacement*: Athens
2. View <span class="fa fa-fw fa-eye"></span> the result

<p style="text-align:right"><a href="{{site.url}}{{page.url}}"><strong>Go Up</strong><span class="fa fa-fw fa-arrow-up"></span></a></p>

## Removing Columns
We can remove columns from a table using either `Remove columns by heading` if your table has a header line, 
or `Cut columns from a table` if it does not (in this case we just indicate columns by their number). 
These tools can also be used to change the order of columns in your file. 
There is also the tool `Advanced Cut columns from a table` that offers a few more options.

Suppose we want to simplify our file a bit. All we want is file with 4 columns: athlete name, sport, olympic games, and medals.

1. `Remove columns by heading` tool with the following parameters: 
   * *Tabular File*: olympics.tsv 
   * *Header name*: name 
   * *Header name*: sport 
   * *Header name*: games 
   * *Header name*: medals 
   * *Keep named columns*: Yes
2. View <span class="fa fa-fw fa-eye"></span> the result

## Unique
Let’s say we would like to create a list of all unique athletes (id and name).

1. `Cut columns from a table` tool using the following parameters: 
   * *Cut Columns*: c1,c2 
   * *Delimited By*: TAB 
   * *From*: olympics.tsv
2. View <span class="fa fa-fw fa-eye"></span> the result
3. `Unique - occurrences of each record` tool with the following parameters: 
   * File to scan for unique values*: output from the first step
4. View <span class="fa fa-fw fa-eye"></span> the result

<p style="text-align:right"><a href="{{site.url}}{{page.url}}"><strong>Go Up</strong><span class="fa fa-fw fa-arrow-up"></span></a></p>

## Concatenating
Our dataset was created in 2021, but since then we’ve had another Olympic event, 
the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. 
If we have the same data for this latest Olympics, 
we could simply add the rows from the 2022 games to our current file with data, 
in order to create a single file with all data from 1896 to 2022.

1. Upload the  dataset `olympics.tsv`
    ```shell 
    https://zenodo.org/record/6803028/files/olympics_2022.tsv
    ```
2. `Remove beginning of a file`  with the following parameters: 
   * *Remove first*: 1
   * *from*: olympics_2022.tsv
3. `Concatenate datasets tail-to-head` with the following parameters: 
   * *Concatenate Datasets*: olympics.tsv 
   * *Insert Dataset*: output from previous step 1 (2022 data without the header)
