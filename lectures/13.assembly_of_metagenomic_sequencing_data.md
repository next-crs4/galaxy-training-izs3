Metagenomics involves the extraction, sequencing and analysis of combined genomic DNA from entire microbiome samples. 
It includes then DNA from **many different organisms**, with different taxonomic background.

Reconstructing the genomes of microorganisms in the sampled communities is critical step in analyzing metagenomic data. 
To do that, we can use **assembly** and assemblers, 
i.e. computational programs that stich together the small fragments of sequenced DNA produced by sequencing instruments.

For a thorough analysis of the community, 
metagenomic shotgun reads can be assembled with the help of available reference genomes (**reference-based assembly**) 
or de novo (**de-novo assembly**).

Assembling seems intuitively similar to putting together a jigsaw puzzle. 

Ideally, the result of a metagenome assembly process should be a set of genomes of all the species 
that are represented within the input data. 
In reality, this end result is still very difficult to achieve. 

**Metagenomic assembly** is further complicated by:

* the large volume of data produced 
* the quality of the sequence 
* the unequal representation of members of the microbial community 
* the presence of closely related microorganisms with similar genomes 
* the presence of several strains of the same microorganism 
* an insufficient amount of data for minor community members

For assembly, there are 3 main strategies:

1. Greedy extension 
2. Overlap Layout Consensus 
3. De Bruijn graphs.

In this tutorial, 
we will learn how to run metagenomic assembly tool and evaluate the quality of the generated assemblies. 

We will use data from the study: 
[Temporal shotgun metagenomic dissection of the coffee fermentation ecosystem](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/studies/MGYS00005630#overview). 

For an in-depth analysis of the structure and functions of the coffee microbiome, 
a temporal shotgun metagenomic study (six time points) was performed. 
The six samples have been sequenced with Illumina MiSeq utilizing whole genome sequencing.

## Assembly

As explained before, there are many challenges to metagenomics assembly, including:

1. differences in coverage between samples, resulting from differences in abundance, 
2. the fact that different species often share conserved regions 
3. the presence of multiple strains of a single species

To reduce the differences in coverage between samples, 
we can use a **co-assembly** approach, where reads from all samples are aligned together:

![]({{site.url}}/images/co-assembly.png)

Pros of co-assembly | Cons of co-assembly
------|-------------------
More data | Higher computational overhead
Better/longer assemblies | Risk of shattering your assembly
Access to lower abundant organisms | Risk of increased contamination

**Co-assembly** is then not always beneficial:
* Changes in strain can cause the assembly graph to collapse
* Binned contigs are likely to be misclassified: MAGs must be treated as a population genom

**Co-assembly** is reasonable if:

* Same samples
* Same sampling event 
* Longitudinal sampling of the same site 
* Related samples

If it is not the case, **individual assembly** should be preferred. 
In this case, an extra step of **de-replication** should be used

<img src="{{site.url}}/images/individual-assembly.png">

Co-assembly is more commonly used than individual assembly and then de-replication after binning. 
But in this tutorial, to show all steps, we will run an **individual assembly**.

**NOTE!** Sometimes it is important to run assembly tools both on individual samples and on all pooled samples, 
and use both outputs to get the better outputs for the certain dataset.

Several tools are available for metagenomic assembly. But 2 are the most used ones:

* [**MetaSPAdes**](https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.213959.116): a short-read assembler designed specifically for large and complex metagenomics datasets. 
  - It is particularly optimal for high-coverage metagenomes 
  - with the best contig metrics 
  - produces few under-collapsed/over-collapsed repeats 
* [**MEGAHIT**](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv033): a single node assembler for large and complex metagenomics NGS reads, such as soil.
  - It is currently the most efficent computationally assembler: it has the lowest memory and time consumption.
  - It produced some of the best assemblies (irrespective of sequencing coverage) with the fewest structural errors 
  - outperforms in recovering the genomes of closely related strains 
  - **but** has a bias towards relatively low coverage genomes leading to a suboptimal assembly of high abundant community member genomes in very large datasets  

Both tools are available in Galaxy. But currently, only `MEGAHIT` can be used in individual mode for several samples.

A typical assembly workflow consists of:

1. Processing with quality control/trimming (`FastQC` and `Trim Galore!` or `Cutadapt`)
2. Assembly with either `MEGAHIT` or `MetaSPAdes` 
3. Estimation of the assembly quality statistics with `MetaQUAST` or `Quast`
4. Identification of potential assembly error signature with `VALET` 
5. Determination of percentage of unmapped reads with `Bowtie2` combined with `MultiQC` to aggregate the results.

## Individual assembly with MEGAHIT
1. `MEGAHIT` Tool with parameters
   - *Select your input option*: Paired-end collection 
   - *Run in batch mode?*: Run individually
   - *Select a paired collection*: Raw reads
   - *Basic assembly options*
     - *K-mer specification method*: Specify min, max, and step values 
     - *Minimum kmer size*: 21 
     - *Maximum kmer size*: 91 
     - *Increment of kmer size of each iteration*: 12
2. Don't RUN
   <img src="{{site.url}}/images/assembly_MEGAHIT.png">
3. Since the assembly process would take **~1h** we are just going to import the results of the assembly previously run.
```shell
https://zenodo.org/record/7818827/files/contigs_ERR2231567.fasta
https://zenodo.org/record/7818827/files/contigs_ERR2231568.fasta
https://zenodo.org/record/7818827/files/contigs_ERR2231569.fasta
https://zenodo.org/record/7818827/files/contigs_ERR2231570.fasta
https://zenodo.org/record/7818827/files/contigs_ERR2231571.fasta
https://zenodo.org/record/7818827/files/contigs_ERR2231572.fasta
```
4. Create a collection named **MEGAHIT Contig**, rename your pairs with the sample name

`MEGAHIT` produced a collection of output assemblies - one per sample - 
that can be proceeded further in binning step and then de-replication. 

The output contains **contigs**, contiguous lengths of genomic sequences in which bases are known to a high degree of certainty.

Contrary to `MetaSPAdes`, 
`MEGAHIT` does not output **scaffolds**, i.e. *segments of genome sequence reconstructed from contigs and gaps*. 

The gaps occur when reads from the two sequenced ends of at least one fragment overlap with other reads 
from two different contigs (as long as the arrangement is otherwise consistent with the contigs being adjacent). 
It is possible to estimate the number of bases between contigs based on fragment lengths.

<span class="fa fa-fw fa-question-circle"></span> **Question**
1. How many contigs has been for ERR2231568 sample? 
2. And for ERR2231572? 
3. What is the minimum length of the contigs?

---

### Assembly statistics

See [Quast Manual](https://quast.sourceforge.net/docs/manual.html#sec3.1)

1. **Genome statistics**
    - **Genome fraction (%):** percentage of aligned bases in the reference genome
   
         <span class="fa fa-fw fa-question-circle"></span> **Question**

         - What is the genome fraction for ERR2231568? And for ERR2231572? 
         - Which reference genome has the highest genome fraction for ERR2231568? And for ERR2231572?

    - **Duplication ratio:** total number of aligned bases / genome fraction * reference length
   
         <span class="fa fa-fw fa-question-circle"></span> **Question**

         - What is the duplication ratio for ERR2231568? And for ERR2231572?
         - Which reference genome has the highest duplication ratio for ERR2231568? And for ERR2231572?
      
2. **Read mapping**: results of the mapping of the raw reads on the different assemblies (only if the *Reads options* is not disabled)
   - Alternative ways to compute coverage:
     - `CoverM-CONTIG` Tool with parameters:  
       - *Read type*: Paired collection 
       - *One or more pairs of forward and reverse possibly gzipped FASTA/Q files for mapping in order*: Raw Reads
     - `Bowtie2` Tool with the following parameters:  
       - *Is this single or paired library*: Paired-end Dataset Collection
       - *FASTQ Paired Dataset*: Raw reads
       - *Will you select a reference genome from your history or use a built-in index?*: Use a genome from the history and build index
       - *Select reference genome*: MEGAHIT output
       - *Save the Bowtie2 mapping statistics to the history*: Yes
       
3. **Misassemblies**: joining sequences that should not be adjacent.
4. **Mismatches** or mismatched bases in the contig-reference alignment
5. Statistics without reference
    - **# contigs:** total number of contigs
    - **Largest contig:** length of the longest contig in the assembly
    - **N50:** length for which the collection of all contigs of that length or longer covers at least half an assembly

      N50 statistic defines assembly quality in terms of contiguity. If all contigs in an assembly are ordered by length, the N50 is the minimum length of contigs that contains 50% of the assembled bases. For example, an N50 of 10,000 bp means that 50% of the assembled bases are contained in contigs of at least 10,000 bp.
   
      When comparing N50 values from different assemblies, the assembly sizes must be the same size in order for N50 to be meaningful.
    - **L50:** number of contigs equal to or longer than N50
      
      In other words, L50 is the minimal number of contigs that cover half the assembly.

## Icarus contig browser
Icarus generates contig size viewer and one or more contig alignment viewers 
(if reference genome/genomes are provided) that are accessible from the HTML report, 
by clicking on **View on Icarus contig browser**.

### Contig size viewer

This viewer draws contigs ordered from longest to shortest. Let’s inspect this viewer for ERR2231568.
1. Open the **Contig size viewer** for `ERR2231568` 
2. define **start** as `0` and **end** as `500000`

<img src="{{site.url}}/images/contig_size_viewer.png">


<span class="fa fa-fw fa-question-circle"></span> **Question**
1. What is the color of the first contig? Why? 
2. What is the red contig?


<span class="fa fa-fw fa-lightbulb-o"></span> **Solutions**
1. The first contig is white because >50% of the contigs is unaligned. By clicking on the contig, 
   we see that only a small block is aligned: 
   
   **223.41 – 223.65 kbp to Leuconostoc_pseudomesenteroides_KCTC_3652_NZ_BMBP01000002.1.**
2. The red contig is a missamblied contig: it contains 2 blocks, with a translocation between them.

Click **Main menu** on the top left to go back to the main Icarus page.

### Contig alignment viewer

If a reference genome is provided, there should be a table on the main Icarus page that looks like:

<img src="{{site.url}}/images/contig_alignment_viewer.png">

When clicking on the genome name, the contigs are displayed according to their mapping to the reference genome. 
The viewer can additionally visualize genes, operons, and read coverage distribution along the genome, 
if any of those were fed to QUAST.

1. Open the Contig alignment viewer for **ERR2231568** and **Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides KCTC 3652**, 
the most covered by contigs


<img src="{{site.url}}/images/KCTC-3652.png">


<span class="fa fa-fw fa-question-circle"></span> **Question**
1. How are the organized the contigs on the top? 
2. What the different colors for the contigs? 
3. Why is there a big red block on the right? 
4. What is the graph on the bottom?

<span class="fa fa-fw fa-lightbulb-o"></span> **Solutions**
1. The contigs are displayed based on their mapping on the reference genome of Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides KCTC 3652 
2. The different colors represent the different status for the contig: correct contigs, correct contigs but with >50% of the contig unaligned, misassembled blocks. unchecked misassembled blocks, ambiguously mapped contigs, alternative blocks of misassembled contigs, etc. 
3. The big red block on the right is contig k91_88833 with a misassembly on the left side, and overlap with 2 other contigs 
4. The graph on the bottom represents the GC percentage and coverage by contigs along the reference genome

## Identification of potential assembly error signature

`VALET` (VALidating mETagenomic assemblies) is a pipeline for performing de novo validation of metagenomic assemblies. 

`VALET` checks a number of properties that should hold true for a correct assembly 
(e.g., mate-pairs are aligned at the correct distance from each other in the assembly, 
the depth of coverage is fairly uniform along contigs, etc.). 

The violations of these invariants are reported allowing one to pinpoint areas that were potentially mis-assembled, 
or to compare the quality of different assemblies. 
For comparing multiple assemblies of the same data-sets, 
`VALET` also reports an overall estimate of the likelihood a particular assembly is correct.

1. `VALET` Tool with paramaters:
   - *Insert Candidate assemblies*:
     - *Candidate assembly file*: contigs from `metaSpades`
     - *Name of the assembly*: spades
  
   - *Insert Candidate assemblies*:
     - *Candidate assembly file*: contigs from `MEGAHIT`
     - *Name of the assembly*: megahit
     
   - *Type of input reads used for the assembly*: Paired-collection
   - *Input format*: FASTQ
   - *Assembly input reads*: Raw Reads
2. Inspect the output files

## Conclusion
Metagenomic data can be assembled to, ideally, 
obtain the genomes of the species that are represented within the input data. 
But metagenomic assembly is complex and there are

* **different approaches** like de Bruijn graphs methods
* **different strategies**, such as co-assembly, when we assembly all samples together, and individual assembly, when we assembly samples one by one
* **different** tools like `MetaSPAdes` and `MEGAHIT`
