## Learning outcomes

* Utilize Galaxy to upload data, employ tools, view project histories, and execute workflows. 
* Employ statistical and scatterplot analysis to explore datasets. 
* Proficiently manage data, including conversion, reformatting, filtering, and sorting of text-based information. 
* Determine the most suitable approach for metagenomic data analysis. 
* Discriminate between tools suited for amplicon and shotgun data analysis. 
* Effectively visualize community structures. 
* Execute 16S rRNA sequencing analysis within Galaxy using the mothur toolsuite. 
* Assess sequencing experiment error rates via mock community data. 
* Master the visualization of sample diversity through Krona and Phinch tools. 
* Execute rigorous quality control of NGS raw data. 
* Extract comprehensive community profiles from microbiome datasets. 
* Proficiently reconstruct microorganism genomes within sampled communities. 
* Evaluate the quality of metagenomic assemblies.
* Skillfully annotate bacterial genomes. 
* Visualize and interpret annotated genomic features. 
* Identify variants between reference genomes and read datasets. 
* Interpret SNP data within the context of read alignments to the genome. 
* Analyze the impact of variants on genomic features. 
* Detect pathogens by identifying virulence factor gene products. 
* Characterize strains and identify antimicrobial resistance genes within your samples.
