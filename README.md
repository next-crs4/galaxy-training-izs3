# Training course on Galaxy for metagenomic analysis on targeting and whole genome data 

[ https://next-crs4.github.io/galaxy-training-izs3]( https://next-crs4.github.io/galaxy-training-izs3)
## Welcome!


- Why are we here?

- What are your expectations?

- What do you need Galaxy for?

- What would you like to take home from the course?


## Learning outcomes

* Utilize Galaxy to upload data, employ tools, view project histories, and execute workflows.
* Employ statistical and scatterplot analysis to explore datasets.
* Proficiently manage data, including conversion, reformatting, filtering, and sorting of text-based information.
* Determine the most suitable approach for metagenomic data analysis.
* Discriminate between tools suited for amplicon and shotgun data analysis.
* Effectively visualize community structures.
* Execute 16S rRNA sequencing analysis within Galaxy using the mothur toolsuite.
* Assess sequencing experiment error rates via mock community data.
* Master the visualization of sample diversity through Krona and Phinch tools.
* Execute rigorous quality control of NGS raw data.
* Extract comprehensive community profiles from microbiome datasets.
* Proficiently reconstruct microorganism genomes within sampled communities.
* Evaluate the quality of metagenomic assemblies.
* Skillfully annotate bacterial genomes.
* Visualize and interpret annotated genomic features.
* Identify variants between reference genomes and read datasets.
* Interpret SNP data within the context of read alignments to the genome.
* Analyze the impact of variants on genomic features.
* Detect pathogens by identifying virulence factor gene products.
* Characterize strains and identify antimicrobial resistance genes within your samples.
