# Training course on Galaxy for metagenomic analysis on targeting and whole genome data 

## Welcome!


- Why are we here?

- What are your expectations?

- What do you need Galaxy for?

- What would you like to take home from the course?


## Learning outcomes

- Uploading files, using tools, viewing histories, and running workflows.
- Exploring datasets with statistics and scatterplots
- Handling data: converting, reformating, filtering, sorting etc text-based data
- Choosing the best approach to analyze metagenomics data
- Selection of tools to analyze amplicon data or shotgun data
- Visualisation of a community structure
- Analyze of 16S rRNA sequencing data using the mothur toolsuite in Galaxy
- Using a mock community to assess the error rate of your sequencing experiment
- Visualize sample diversity using Krona and Phinch


## Computing resources

The computing resources for this training have been provided by the
CRS4 datacenter
